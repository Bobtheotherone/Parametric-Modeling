This package contains comprehensive tests demonstrating the full M3 capability:

1. Project initialization (m3 init)
2. Artifact creation and content-addressed storage
3. Lineage graph tracking and provenance
4. Dataset snapshot creation and versioning
5. Garbage collection with retention policies
6. Audit and verification

The tests serve as both integration tests and documentation.
